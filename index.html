        <h2>Parallax Website Examples</h2>
        <p><br><br><br><br>There hasn’t been a design style that has captured the web’s creative community like that of parallax website design in ages, which, in non-industry terms, is about a few months. You might be wondering what parallax website design is.

            Well, actually you have heard it, and seen its used for some time now. Before going into showcasing some really well-designed websites utilizing parallax design, let’s take some time to examine and explain what it is.<br><br><br>
            
            By definition, parallax means the apparent displacement or the difference in apparent direction of an object as seen from two different points not on a straight line with the object. In web design use, parallax refers to the scrolling technique used to create the illusion of depth on websites.<br><br><br>
            
            This technique is not new. However, this technique has been around for quite some time in the web design community before its recent rise to a trending style. The use of this technology to create the illusion of depth can also be traced back to older forms of media, like old school video games for instance. Below you’ll find some nicely designed websites that masterfully utilize this hot new trend.<br><br><br>
            
            To show you how this Parallax scrolling effect looks like I’ve collected sites that utilize the Parallax scrolling effect. Check out the following examples below.<br><br><br>
            
            
            <strong> Layered Method</strong> – The use of multiple backgrounds that can move independently horizontally or vertically, depending on your preference, and can be composited on one another.<br><br>
            <strong>The Sprite Method </strong>– Simply put, using one big image comprised of multiple images that displays only parts of that said image when at different positions. A commonly used effect in navigation menus.<br><br>
            <strong>The Repeating Pattern Method </strong>– Scrolling displays built up of individual tiles can be made to float over a repeating background layer<br><br>
        <strong>The Raster Method</strong> – Lines of pixels in an image are typically composited and refreshed in top-to-bottom order with a slight delay between drawing one line and drawing the next line
